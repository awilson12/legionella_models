# This code is related to a submission to  *Water Research* :

Amanda M. Wilson, Kelly Canter, Sarah E. Abney, Charles P. Gerba, Eric R. Myers, John Hanlin, Kelly Reynolds. An application for relating  *Legionella*  shower water monitoring results to estimated health outcomes. Under review.


Here, we compare 2 models: One developed by Schoen & Ashbolt (2011), DOI:10.1021/acs.est.8b03000, and another developed by Hamilton et al. (2019), DOI:10.1021/acs.est.8b03000. We then use one of these models to develop an RShiny app as a proof of concept.

# automated_code.R #

This code can be run to produce figures 1-3 from the drafted manuscript. This file sources on other files 

# App-1 #

Within the App-1 folder, app_v2.R can be run to view the proof of concept app.
